This is my personnal web site inpisred by Dji. Trying to reproduce most faithfully the real site but by changing some part by my own appreciations.
I chose this website because I really like the brand and it's a good reference site, well built.


- **Project:** Website presenting a fake version of DJi web site chain called "FakeJi".
- **Structure of website:** Multi-page responsive website. Each page present one thing.
                            <br>-accessible pages: home page, store and purchase page.

## Project
You can see the project with this link to the github page.

## Process

I didn't start with the main page because the page on the fpv part inspired me more. Each addition to my site was done in three steps: 
- first I explored the original site and took the most interesting parts.
- I was thinking about the construction of the chosen part and how to implement it.
- And for finish I fix all detail and bug and check if the web site still responsive.

I then added some page that interested me the most.This is an exquisite first and I intend to add more pages in the future, until I get to the full site in the future.
